339,Why make this code change? What was deleted and what was added? Does it make sense? Does it make the program more efficient?,"Intention, Efficiency, Does it make sense?","Machine seemed much shorter and more concise. It felt more ""efficient"".",Not really,No,"Maybe. If has style errors, memory leaks, etc., then yes. But if it is about trade-off choices (memory vs run-time) I would prefer a software developer."
401,The comment. If the comment matches the code,The comment matching the code,I trust the machine-generated code changes less,Not sure,Women had better comments,yes. Industry no affect
310,Description of the change. The lines that were added and deleted. Looked at what chnaged from line-to-line. Also considered how the code or variables were used earlier or later in the file.,If the description matched the code changes made. Reading the description -- did the description appear to be useful. Looking at the change & verifying the correctness.,It was generally as good as human-gnerated changes. Although one time it simply swapped variables' positions without any reason. The descriptions from the computer were hit-or-miss; some were too vague and others were way too long and technical. The code produced by both computer and humn seemed equally readable.,"No, I didn't detect any differences. It seemed to me that both men and women had some code changes which were faulty. I didn't notice any differences in the quality of the descriptions or the overall readability of their code either.",I had not considered the gender of the code reviewer since I was in that role. I would think that there is probably some bias towards programmers of the opposite gender. Male reviewers might judge a woman's code more harshly while female reviewers might not examine a male's code as in-depth.,"Yes, as long as I have the opportunity to review the cose. It doesn't matter who generated/wrote the code, be it a machine, male, or female, as long as the code is correct & it has been validated by someone else, it should be allowed in the code base."
412,I check whether the change will make a difference on the function of the code and whether there is any syntax error. I look at what was deleted and how it has been added. ,"Is the code necessary, is the code correct, is there a syntax error",I think the machine-generated code changes are usually necessary and almost no system errors.,I can't tell any difference between the code written by men and women,"Maybe male code reviewers would pay much attention to the function of code, and female reviewers to both the function of the code and the style.",I will be willing to if I would have a chance to hae a formal check.
403,I was checking to make sure if the comments agreed with the code changes. I was mainly looking at the red & green portion of the code.,"Code understandability, code making sense or not, code agreed with comments",I think the code generated was more confusing and harder to read. It seemed more complicated than the human-generated code.,I don't really think there was much different between men/women code. But if I remember correctly the code by women was shorter,"No, I don't think there would be difference between male/female code revewers. Difference would only matter is there was a difference in code ability.","No, I don't think I have trust with machine-generated code. I would want to test/review any code generated by the machine."
409,Does the code change match the English description. Is the code change neccesary. Could new bugs be introduced by this change. Is the change short and simple or long and complex.,Does the code change match the description. Are there code smells (potential issues). Is the change neccesary.,"The changes seemed simpler. It didn't always seem that machine-generated code changes could have been automatic. When the process seemed like something a linter could do, I felt most confident in the machine-generated fixes. Suspicious about comments. Expect the problem to be simpler.","On average men may have more experience because they are less likely to leave the industry. However, for men and women at the same level of expertise, I do not think there is a difference.","I am aware of the claim that people don't accept code reviews for females as often. Males on average may be more confortable with code review systems since they are more likely to be involved in OSS. However, once people reach industry, it probably levels out.",As long as I could check it first. *Opensource experience: my own code is checked & check others' code e.g. experienced prog link issue start from basic trust accept. Formatting situation student prog. Suspicious rejct: formatting.
404,"I looked for anything obviously incorrect, and consistent style with the limited context. I generally trusted the humans and distrusted the computers.","Corectness, style, human or computer","I didn't notice a difference. *Start out as a programmer in industry: care about style, readability. Now: what it does, performance.",No,No,As long as someone is reviewing it
315,Correctness of the change. Quality of the comment. Whether or not I understand the change.,"Correctness of the change, quality of the comment, my understanding of the change ",Machine-generated seemed to be fixes instead of big additions. The machine tended to have correct changes as well.,I don't think there was any difference.,I have not observed any differences,"Yes, as long as it is correct and does not break existing code."
306,"Change summary at top, added code, reviewed code, filename.","Seeing if change summary matched w/ what was added/removed, change summary succinctness and understandability, whether it was human or auto-generated","I feel that human-generated code had much more variance in quality and ease-of-understanding, while machine-generated code was usually formatted w.r.t. guidelines. Readability is more likely of higher quality w/ generated code.",I did not consciously perceive any significant differences. ,"I thought about potential differences, but did not consciously observe any.","Yes, I suppose I trust the algorithms. Startup exp: bad with standards."
302,"It was impossible to know the correctness of the code up for review so I looked at if the changes made sense from the description and if these were a big change, that there were comments added","Comments, change matched description",Machine-generated code did not come with comments. Otherwise it felt perfectly similar to human code.,Did not consider gender when evaluating code,No,"After reviewing and commenting, yes"
345,"I looked at the commit message then the actual changes, if there were no obvious mistakes I usually approved, even if I didn't understand the code. I was pretty lenient with my approvals","Commit message, general code logic, readability",The machine-generated ones were more about proper usage/style of code so I usually trusted those changes.,I wasn't really paying enough attention to gender to pick up any code differences.,"I assume female code reviews are more hesitant about making criticisms, I definitely hesitated in rejecting code changes","No, seems unpredicatable and I would be wary it'll break my code base. It also depends on the project and its sensitivity to change."
411,"If the code change matches the description. If the code change only ""adding statements"". If the code change serves as a check of corner cases/exception handling. If the code change is by an actual person.","If the code change matches the description, if the code change serves as a check of corner cases/exception handling, if the code change only ""adding statements"". ","Machine-generated changes are IMO less readable, a little worse in quality, capable in fewer scopes (for example could not fix typos), less capable to generate concise & meaningful commit messages.",No,No,"Yes, but only if the code change is about fixing a bug about for example: using a wrong variable or using a wrong check fr loop termination/error/corner cases."
328,Is the fix correct (logical + syntax errors). Whether the comment relates to the fix. If the fix introduces a new issue. First I read the comment then I tried to determine if the code change accomplished the task listed.,"Correctness, understandability + relatedness to comment, doesn't introduce issues.",Machine-generated issues were often less readable and typically had more difficult to understand comments. They sometimes seemed to lack the context that a person would have and sometimes the fixes they applied seemed very verbose as compared with the average human patch.,I felt that code changes made by women more often would have better comment descriptions.,I have not observed any disparity. But I also have only had 1 female code reviewer work with me consistently and ~10 male reviewers.,"No, I would rather see the suggestions it makes and translate it into more readable code for maintainability purpses. *Industry internship: 1st intern: thought logic errors. 1nd: noticed they fixed non-logic stuff. Non-logic stuff is more annoying than logic-errors."
351,Request message (hopefully explaining why we need the proposed change). Previous code. Proposed change. Variable declarations for context. File type (semicolon question - depends on language),"Request message, proposed change (is it correct), previous code (is it incorrect)",I feel like I accepted fewer of the machine-generated code -- sometimes I think the changes didn't make sense.,Didn't notice any. Maybe the quality was higher for women? I feel I accepted more of these.,Not really,If I review it and it's accurate
415,PR message is descriptive. I understand the code change. Code change matches the message. Code is good stylistically/functionallly.,"Code looks good/makes sense, understand the changes being made, PR message makes sense with code",I didn't notice significant differences between human and software-generated code.,No,No,"Yes, so long that it is human reviewed. *Industry: message is descriptive and w/o looking at code can know what it did."
417,I relied on my prior knowledge and context provided with each situation. Situation involves knowledge I posess. Context provided. Does it make sense to me. More skeptical with computer pull requests.,"Does the change make sense, is there enough context provided to make a decision, does it feel right","They seemed like good starter points for further human coder investigation, but I would hesitate to include them without further human investigation. They seemed useful enough.",No,Not really. Some people probably falsely assume that there is a difference.,"Yes, but I would check it thoroughly"
340,If the comments at the top were consistent/made sense with what was happening. If it generally made sense (variable and function names).,"Function names of what you're doing made sense, consistent with comments, logic made sense",Honestly was not paying attention to which ones did which so maybe say something in advance for people to look for it.,"No, did not take pitures into consideration. I'm guessing the ones that had question marks/seemed more unsure were female","Females can be more descriptive with the comments, I think. Also the uncertainty mentioned above.","I feel like I would [undecipherable word] if I really check it first, bit blindly accept it but other than that I wouldn't have a problem w/ it if I thought it was right."
406,"Is the comment relevant to the change, because if it's not, it becomes difficult to maintain code in enterprises. Comments changes and typos are usually accepted. If else statements need extra care. Version specific changes done by computer repair is usually correct","Comment and change relevance, corner cases handling, Bias towards computer-generated repair","Machine-generated code changes dealt with versions or cases which a compiler can optimize. So they are less likely to be incorrect. On the other hand, human-generated changes deal with the actual logic and one cannot really review a lot of the logic part unless there is a [undecipherable word] explanatory comment or one knows the entire logic. *It will be helpful if a break of 30 secs to 1 min is provided where the reviewers can just relax. This will help him/her to concentrate more.",I didn't notice the difference so I can't comment anything. ,I didn't think in that direction.,"Yes, definitely. Because sometimes the developer doesn't know some version-specific details which a machine can add. But machine-generated [undecipherable word] should also be reviewed seriously to check that their changes are not interfering with the main logic. *Your industry experience told you ""there's no diff"" used to be biased before industry: ""male is better at coding"" -> industry exp helps you to eliminate the bias"
300,"Comments, clarity, logic, functionality","Comments, Clarity, Function",Machine-generated is more rigid and verbose,Wasn't really paying attention,No,Yes -> especially for dependency updates + migrations
311,Whether code seemed to line up with what commit said. Check for syntaxical errors.,"Does code fulfill purpose, are there obvious errors, does change make sense (this would be higher, but I don't know the context of the change)","They seemed pretty similar, it could have fooled me that they were machine-generated",I wouldn't be suprised if men are more bad/less careful but I assume if there are differences they aren't too big,"Not very much, I didn't really notice a difference in the pull requests.","Only for certain error catching, not for building new features though boilerplate stuff would probably be okay."
320,"First, check the comment for the pull request, then compare what was changed and the differences. I try to see if it makes sense. If comment was vague, I would reject.","Pull request comment, the magnitude of the change, if it was automated or made by human",The code seemed more readable. I trusted the automated software repair tools but became suspicious when the code change didn't make sense.,I did not notice many differences. Maybe code written by women were shorter.,Not really,Yes
400,Details in comment | if they used clear descriptions or gave reasons for a change. Comments with a lot of notation/variable names were not as helpful. Then looked at code additions and read surrounding code if context was needed.,"clear/well-explained comment, match between code change and comment description, match between change and surrounding context",The machine-generated changes seemes to have better comments. Code quality seemed similar to human changes -- however machine-generated changes were often minor (fewer edits overall).,No noticeable difference in code. I think Women often had more detailed comments though. A few of the comments I thought were sparse/not helpful were there written by men (at least from what I remember).,"Not really - may be differences about how they approach the review, i.e. if they rely more heavily on the programmer's comments (as I do) or look only at the code.","Yes! After review, or course"
336,Patch description - understand what the patch does. File name. Form code sections vs new code: how does he/she do it,"Description, code correctness, code style","In my experience, code style checkers & automated code fixers are more conservative than human, more likely to be correct though might not be as readable as human's",I don't observe a distinct difference,No,Yes. I think large open-source projects are already using scripts & programs to patch their codebase. i.g. Linux kernel's been using perlscript & some more advanced tools to do so
305,Complexity of change. Detail in comment. Correctness of change.,"Detail in change comment, complexity of change, correctness",Machine-generated changes were usually about edge cases that humans might miss but that can be detected automatically. Machine-generated changes improved readability. They did not make conceptual changes,[blank],[blank],[blank]
330,I looked at the commit message and then looked at the code changes that were made. Code changes (functionality). Readability. Code changes relating to the commit message (reasoning in the commit message),"Readability, functionality of code, commit message",The machine-generated code did not seem to be as high of quality. It was mostly very minor things that were changed or a repeat of some of the code just written slightly differently.,I didn't really notice any differences between the code written by men or women. Didn't really process the gender into my evaluation of the code.,Didn't notice any differences,"Yes, a lot of times machine-generated code helps to keep the structure and makes the code more-maintainable"
327,"Context of code being added. Surrounding, unmodified code. Commit message / reason for change. Function / file being edited. Observable effexts of the proposed change.","Commit message, Quality of the code being added, Size/influence of the proposed change",The commit messages were generally less wordy and didn't add much which made it hard to understand why the changes were happening. There were fewer comments w/ machine-generated code. It wasn't neccesarily less readable or worse but I did feel inclined to trust it less because it is not a human.,"I didn't notice any. If there were some they could relate to style, number of comments, etc.",I haven't observed any differences. I imagine there may be differences related to how each gender approaches the proposed code.,Not without human review or testing beforehand
314,Commit message vs. actual change. Semantics of commit (does it resemble realistic code). Quality of comments.,"Change matches commit message, change matches surrounding code structure, spelling/ good naming",Mostly the machine-generated commits seemed about as good as the human changes; however I did notice a couple of commits where the machine uncommented things that shouldn't have been uncommented.,I didn't notice any significant  differences between male/female written code.,"I think female code reviewers might pay more attention to fine details in the codebase, but that's a hunch/guess.","As long as we review + test the code changes first, yes."
325,"Commit message. Code change. Understanding the logic if I feel familiar w/ it. If uncertain, tend to trust robot more as I believe they run regression & automated tests. Do not consider how a person looks","Commit message, code change (understandability), how much code changed",Machine-generated commit messages were often much easier to understand and coding style more consistent. Don't feel knowledgeable enough to say whether it had better overall code.,"No, I intentionally only discriminated machines & humans, not otherwise.","No, see above","Yes, if it passes code reviews & automated tests"
322,What the comment was saying. If it seemed like the change made sense. If the change affected the program.,"If change added functionality/fixed defect, if change could improve code performace, if change made code more readable",I felt the computer-generated code was more likely to create a nonsensical change. Less readble than human-generated changes,No major differences I can recall,No,"Yes, but should be human reviewed to prevent nonsensical mistakes"
338,"First see what's being detected & see the relevance between deleted contents w/ added or modified code, if any","Degree od changes (how much was changed), readability (of if I can actually understand what's going on), relevance to the rest of the code, if visible",Machine-generated tend to be similar with the ones deleted in terms of code structure (variable name & its assignment). I had more trouble understanding human-generated code changes,"No, because I didn't pay too much attention to the profile pictures",No,Only if it's already reviewed by a human
407,"Commit messages, comments, basic code logic, naming","Commit messages, code logic, comments",Better commit messages in general,No,No,Yes
301,Pull request description. Lines removed and the subsequent lines added. Try to do a character-by-character diff test in my head ,"Commit description, lines removed, lines added",[blank],[blank],Not that I could tell (from industry experience),"Yes, but with a tougher inspection"
329,Whether there were magic constants in the code (put as global constant instead). Whether the logic of the new code made sense given what I saw. Whether the names of variables/function calls were appropriate. Whether the commit messages were correct/made sense. Whether certain types conversions were neccesary (I would question why an unsigned long is neccesary),"Correct functionality, Maintainability (single point of maintenance - for example hard-coded numbers not appealing), readability","The machine-generated code changes were generally easier to review. The problems that they fixed generally involved less context to understand, and so were easier to comprehend than some human-generated samples. Due to the spacing and the fact that the names of fans/variables weren't changed by the machines the code was also easier to read. However, the relative quality was lower. For example, the machine seemed to make some questionable typecasts in certain places, and also tried to change the logic of code in one case (when it moved a bool saved in cariable ""ack"" within parenthesis iirc it reversed the if() check incorrectly).","I think I may be more inclined to slap together code that works but looks messy, whereas women may pay attention more to little things such as spacing, braces, naming. I remember questioning the correctness of a piece of code written by a woman, but not for a man. But this was, at least I think a coincidence.","Perhaps male code reviewers will be more skepticalof code written by women, and female code reviewers will be more cautious in reviewing code written by men due to the dominance of men in the software industry. I think I would be generally more scared to have my code reviewed by a male, but in the end it would depend on the person. Not because I'd be more scared of more mistakes being pointed out, but just because of personality maybe.","Yes, but I'd have to check them first. *industry: more attention to small things e.g. comments, maintenance. *you think you associate male with science more"
353,"description matched what the person did, if they did it correctly,corect syntax, if it is necessary to make the changes",matching description to change; correctly implemented change without a bug; necessary,both machine and human coule be at fault because they could be unnecessarily changing the code with incorrect syntax. But the quality of the mahcine generated code I expected would be better,"no, there arett any differences",No I believe bothe men and women have the same intellectual capabilities to make proper code changes,"Yes but I would want the mahicne gennerated code to be double checked by a human
"

350,if I agree; comments; code change in context,,machine is pickier more edge cases. human are more optimized,"women catch more details, men seem to be altering the meaning of the code",women are more detail-driven.,"yes, better for catching details"
